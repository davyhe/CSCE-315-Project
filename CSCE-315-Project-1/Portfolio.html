        <p style="font-weight:500; color: #990000; text-indent: 50px;" >As an international student coming from China, 
            I look forward to high-quality education in the U.S. since the first I heard of it.
            Therefore, I transferred to Oakridge School, which is located in Arlington, Texas, and spent five years studying there.
            During those years, I fell in love with its beautiful natural environment and abundant activities.
            After graduating from high school, I spent half a year improving my English academic skills at Southern Methodist University.
            Then I got enrolled in my current school, the Kansas State University (KSU) majoring in Computer Engineering.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight:500; color: #990000;text-indent: 50px;" >I became interested in computer technologies when I had my first laptop at 13. 
            My parents used to worry that I would be addicted to computer games since I was too young to be self-disciplined. 
            However, compared to those games, I was more enthusiastic about the computer itself. 
            I was curious how a computer could be so powerful and intelligent to finish a surprisingly large number of complicated works. 
            Beginning with reading some books on the basic knowledge and operations of a computer, 
            I gradually started to operate a computer by myself following instructive videos on YouTube.
            My biggest interest was in learning the latest specs and manufacturing techniques of the CPU and the GPU.
            Since then, I decided to major in Computer Science at university in the future. 
            However, after finding that Computer Science is highly related to computer algorism and programming language, 
            which were what I was unfamiliar with. I wanted a major that combines both algorism and hardware knowledge, 
            and finally end up choosing Computer Engineering as my Major at KSU.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight:500; color: #990000;text-indent: 50px;" >After I finished taking "Intro Computer Engineering" and "Circuit Theory I", 
            which cover basic control embedded systems and the ability to solve complex linear circuits diagrams, 
            I became more confident in the learning of Computer Engineering. 
            My hard work paid back by offering me two A in both of these two courses. I am grateful for what KSU has taught me.
            However, when I am digging into advanced courses, the options are quite limited,
            and I don't have many choices for the senior research project.
            Thus, I end up choosing Texas A&M as my trasnfer school, and enrolled in Fall 2020.
